## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BelieveInTheLimitless/Headout-Globetrotter-Challenge.git
cd Headout-Globetrotter-Challenge
```

### 2. Running the application with Docker

#### Easy Start (Recommended)
We've created convenient scripts to start the entire application with a single command:

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./run.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
run.bat
```

These scripts will start MongoDB, the backend API, and the frontend UI. You can access:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5002
- MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017

#### Manual Docker Compose
Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose directly:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in the background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### 3. Running Locally (Without Docker)

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5002 --reload
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### MongoDB
You'll need MongoDB running locally or via Docker:
```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```
